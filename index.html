             <p>
             Proposed legislation to provide a Universal Basic Income to the families of those incarcerated and to individuals facing re-entry in order to decrease the risk of recidivism by addressing the social determinants of health or root causes that lead to safer communities.
             </p>
             <p>
             Specifically, this proposal aims to:
             </p>
             <ul>
             <li><b>Alleviate Economic Hardship:</b> Recognizing the interconnectedness of financial well-being and positive life outcomes, this proposal directly addresses the economic challenges faced by individuals upon release from incarceration. The UBI acts as a financial safety net, mitigating immediate financial constraints and reducing the likelihood of recidivism due to economic desperation.</li>
             <li><b>Equip Individuals to Meet Basic Needs:</b> This proposal is centered on empowering individuals to meet their fundamental needs. By introducing a UBI, the focus is on creating conditions that enable people to secure housing, food, and essential resources. With a focus on prison abolition and racial equity, the proposal not only seeks to reduce disparities in incarceration rates, but also to provide necessary support for individuals facing hardship by fostering an environment where their basic needs can be met, and they can thrive.</li>
             <li><b>Disrupt the Poverty-to-Prison Pipeline:</b> Recognizing the link between poverty and criminalization, the proposal acts as a preventive measure by offering financial stability. The UBI is designed to support individuals in the reentry process, including families of current inmates. Beyond immediate recipients, the initiative contributes to community well-being by breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. By providing crucial financial support, the initiative supports reentry and community well-being by creating the conditions that break the cycle of adversity, allowing individuals to navigate systemic hardships and overcome economic challenges with tools for accountability and a community of support.</li>
             <li><b>Inform Policy and Structural Interventions:</b> Through investigation and research, the proposal aims to inform policy and structural interventions. By highlighting the exploitation of incarcerated individuals' labor and the lack of reinvestment from prisons, the proposal challenges systemic failures. It advocates for a more just distribution of resources and calls attention to the need for comprehensive, systemic solutions to address the root causes of incarceration. It seeks to understand the transformative potential of UBI as a structural intervention that goes beyond immediate relief, with the goal of breaking the cycle of poverty and incarceration.

            <h3>Problem identification </h3>  <div>
           <p>Research and firsthand experiences consistently highlight the significant economic challenges faced by formerly incarcerated individuals. Upon release, they often receive inadequate financial support, leading to difficulties in meeting basic needs like housing, food, and utilities. This economic strain contributes to high rates of homelessness among this population. Furthermore, barriers such as limited access to public benefits, discrimination in employment and housing, and the inability to vote exacerbate their challenges.</p>

<p>This proposal advocates for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) tailored for individuals impacted by incarceration, aiming to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration. The UBI initiative is seen as a strategic intervention to address systemic inequalities, over-policing, and the poverty-to-prison pipeline. It seeks to provide immediate financial relief while also addressing the structural root causes of these issues.</p>

<p>Initiatives like the Just Income GNV pilot program in Florida are seen as promising models, providing insights into the potential impact of UBI on reentry challenges. The proposal emphasizes the need for comprehensive, systemic solutions to support individuals transitioning from incarceration and create a more just and equitable society.

            <h3>Most impacted demographics</h3>
            <p>Over-policing often targets communities of color (e.g. African Americans, Hispanic/ Latinx, and Indigenous communities), which disproportionately experience economic instability and a lack of resources due to hundreds of years of racialized exploitation, dispossession, and theft of resources.8</p> <p> The criminalization of these groups by those who benefit from the marginalization of these groups exacerbates racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The UBI proposal indirectly addresses this issue by reducing the inequitable socioeconomic conditions that contribute to criminalization. By offering a guaranteed income, the UBI proposal can act as a preventive measure by disrupting the poverty-to-prison pipeline and provides a safety net that can reduce the likelihood of individuals resorting to criminalized activities out of financial desperation or the risk of recidivism due to technical parole violations.9,10 The overarching objective of this initiative is to delve into the potential of UBI in mitigating disparities in incarceration rates and intergenerational poverty, which is often a significant factor in the pathway to incarceration..</p>
